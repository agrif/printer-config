# Printer Configuration

This repository contains [PrusaSlicer][] profiles for my 3D
printers, as well as [Klipper][] configurations. It also has a
hacky tool to lint the PrusaSlicer INI files, removing entries
that are redundant, as well as optionally updating the file
with an exported config bundle.
